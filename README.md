# arkivujo.alfresco.api
This repository is a series of C# (.NET Standard 2.0) libraries for the Alfresco Client REST API.  It aims to be roughly similar to the Alfresco JavaScript API REST Client to support easily creating Alfresco clients in C#.

## What is "Arkivujo"?
"Arkivujo" is the Esperanto translation of the English "Filing Cabinet".  The name was chosen as it identifies the goal of a well rounded document management system.  Arkivujo as a github organization will produce a series of libraries, add-on, extensions, and clients that relate to Alfresco Community Edition which is a mature opensource enterprise content management system. 

## WARNING
This project is in a very early stage.  Use at your own risk.
